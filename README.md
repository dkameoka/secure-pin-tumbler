# Generate secure pin tumbler key codes

* Generates a plain text file containing all of the secure key codes.
* Filters out codes outside Maximum Adjacent Cut Specification (MACS).
* Filters out codes that aren't aggressive; the key cut would be too flat.
* Filters out codes where the second to last pin is at the maximum length to make picking the deepest pin difficult.
